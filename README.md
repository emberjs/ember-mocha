ember-mocha simplifies testing of Ember applications with
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) by providing Mocha-specific wrappers around the
helpers contained in
[@ember/test-helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers).

*Upgrading from an earlier version? Have a look at our
[Migration Guide](docs/migration.md).*


Compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ember.js v3.4 or above
- Ember CLI v2.13 or above
- Node.js 8 or above


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`ember-mocha` is an [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) addon, so install it
as you would any other addon:

```sh
$ ember install ember-mocha
```

Some other addons are detecting the test framework based on the installed
addon names and are expecting `ember-cli-mocha` instead. If you have issues
with this then `ember install ember-cli-mocha`, which should work exactly
the same.


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following section describes the use of Ember Mocha with the latest modern
Ember testing APIs, as laid out in the RFCs
[232](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0232-simplify-qunit-testing-api.md)
and
[268](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0268-acceptance-testing-refactor.md).

For the older APIs have a look at our [Legacy Guide](docs/legacy.md).

### Setting the Application

Your `tests/test-helper.js` file should look similar to the following, to
correctly setup the application required by `@ember/test-helpers`:

```javascript
import Application from '../app';
import config from '../config/environment';
import { setApplication } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { start } from 'ember-mocha';

setApplication(Application.create(config.APP));
start();
```

Also make sure that you have set `ENV.APP.autoboot = false;` for the `test`
environment in your `config/environment.js`.

### Setup Tests

The `setupTest()` function can be used to setup a unit test for any kind
of "module/unit" of your application that can be looked up in a container.

It will setup your test context with:

* `this.owner` to interact with Ember's [Dependency Injection](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.0.0/applications/dependency-injection/)
  system
* `this.set()`, `this.setProperties()`, `this.get()`, and `this.getProperties()`
* `this.pauseTest()` method to allow easy pausing/resuming of tests

For example, the following is a unit test for the `SidebarController`:

```javascript
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { describe, it } from 'mocha';
import { setupTest } from 'ember-mocha';

describe('SidebarController', function() {
  setupTest();

  // Replace this with your real tests.
  it('exists', function() {
    let controller = this.owner.lookup('controller:sidebar');
    expect(controller).to.be.ok;
  });
});
```

If you find that test helpers from other addons want you to pass a `hooks`
object you can do so like this:

```javascript
let hooks = setupTest();
setupMirage(hooks);
```

This will make sure that in functions passed to `hooks.afterEach()` the
`this.owner` and other things that `setupTest()` sets up are still available.
Mocha itself runs `afterEach` hooks in a different order than QUnit, which is
why this "workaround" is sometimes needed.


### Setup Rendering Tests

The `setupRenderingTest()` function is specifically designed for tests that
render arbitrary templates, including components and helpers.

It will setup your test context the same way as `setupTest()`, and additionally:

* Initializes Ember's renderer to be used with the
  [Rendering helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#rendering-helpers),
  specifically `render()`
* Adds `this.element` to your test context which returns the DOM element
  representing the wrapper around the elements that were rendered via
  `render()`
* sets up the [DOM Interaction Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#dom-interaction-helpers)
  from `@ember/test-helpers` (`click()`, `fillIn()`, ...)

```javascript
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { describe, it } from 'mocha';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-mocha';
import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';

describe('GravatarImageComponent', function() {
  setupRenderingTest();

  it('renders', async function() {
    await render(hbs`{{gravatar-image}}`);
    expect(this.element.querySelector('img')).to.exist;
  });
});
```

### Setup Application Tests

The `setupApplicationTest()` function can be used to run tests that interact
with the whole application, so in most cases acceptance tests.

On top of `setupTest()` it will:

* Boot your application instance
* Set up all the [DOM Interaction Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#dom-interaction-helpers)
  (`click()`, `fillIn()`, ...) as well as the [Routing Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#routing-helpers)
  (`visit()`, `currentURL()`, ...) from `@ember/test-helpers`

```javascript
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { describe, it } from 'mocha';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-mocha';
import { visit, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers';

describe('basic acceptance test', function() {
  setupApplicationTest();

  it('can visit /', async function() {
    await visit('/');
    expect(currentURL()).to.equal('/');
  });
});
```
